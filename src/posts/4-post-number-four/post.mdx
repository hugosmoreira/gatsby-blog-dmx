    What is Web Developing? Web development is building and creating websites, web pages, web programming, web publishing, and database management on Internet (World Wide Web) and maintaining it.

<p>
  It's coding or programming that involves how the website will function as per
  the requirements of the owner. How to become a web developer in four easy
  steps:
</p>
<p>1)Learn the basics of web development.</p>
<p>2)Choose a development specialization based on your interests.</p>
<p>
  {' '}
  3)Learn required programming languages according to your development
  specialization.
</p>
<p>4)Practice your web developing skills on various projects.</p>

<p>
  Learn the basics of web development Every web developer must have a basic
  understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML
  (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are basic
  languages you need to learn for becoming a web developer. These are two of the
  core technologies for building web pages and web applications.
</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>
  HTML gives authors the means to publish online documents with headings, text,
  tables, lists, photos, etc. Retrieve online information via hypertext links,
  at the click of a button. Design forms for conducting transactions with remote
  services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering
  products, etc. Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other
  applications directly in their documents.
</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>
  CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including
  colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to
  different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.
  CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
  The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style
  sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>
  Javascript is a text-based programming language and it can be used both for
  the client side and server side that making web pages interactive. HTML and
  CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, Javascript gives
  web pages interactive elements that engage a user. It is the most popular
  language. There is a low threshold to get started and it is actually a fun
  language to learn. It is used for adding interactive behavior for web pages,
  creating web and mobile apps, building web servers and developing server
  applications, game development.
</p>

<p>
  You can learn these languages from various platforms (some are free of cost
  also) such as Youtube, Udemy and Udacity, etc (I will post more links). Here I
  am listing some of the best websites to learn web development for free!

<h3>Web Developers are categorized into three main types:</h3>
<br />

<h3>1. Front - End Developer:</h3>
<p>
  {' '}
  A front-end developer is a programmer that codes the front end of a website.
  Typically, the front-end developer's job is to convert website design files
  into raw HTML, JavaScript (JS), and/or CSS code. This includes the basic
  website design/layout, images, content, buttons, navigation, and internal
  links.
</p>

<h3>2. Back-End Developer:</h3> <p>
  A backend developer is one who makes use of the technology required to develop
  the products for the backend of any website. A backend developer is
  responsible for building the structure of a software application. Backend
  developers typically work in groups or with a team.
</p>

<h3>3. Full-Stack Developer:</h3> <p>
  A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server-side
  — of the application as well as the Front End, or client-side. Full Stack
  Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from
  databases to graphic design and UI/UX management to do their job well. There
  are several other kinds of Web Developers also such as • Mobile Developer •
  Game Developer • Data Scientist Developer • Software Developer
</p>
<br />

Practice Your Web Developing Skills on Various Projects All you need to do is to go to websites like Codewars, HackerOne, and Leetcode. To solve and compete with others in the problems available on those websites. The more you practice, the faster you will develop your skills. Most of these websites will help you go from basic level problems to higher levels step by step. Many government institutions, NGOs, and private institutes across the government-run courses from 6 months certificate courses to Ph.D. level courses.
