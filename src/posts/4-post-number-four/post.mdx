What is Web Developing? Web development is building and creating websites, web pages, web programming, web publishing, and database management on Internet (World Wide Web) and maintaining it.

It's coding or programming that involves how the website will function as per the requirements of the owner. How to become a web developer in four easy steps:
1)Learn the basics of web development.
2)Choose a development specialization based on your interests.
3)Learn required programming languages according to your development specialization.
4)Practice your web developing skills on various projects.

Learn the basics of web development Every web developer must have a basic understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are basic languages you need to learn for becoming a web developer. These are two of the core technologies for building web pages and web applications.

HTML
HTML gives authors the means to publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc. Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button. Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc. Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

CSS
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.

JavaScript
Javascript is a text-based programming language and it can be used both for the client side and server side that making web pages interactive. HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, Javascript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. It is the most popular language. There is a low threshold to get started and it is actually a fun language to learn. It is used for adding interactive behavior for web pages, creating web and mobile apps, building web servers and developing server applications, game development.

You can learn these languages from various platforms (some are free of cost also) such as Youtube, Udemy and Udacity, etc (I will post more links).
Here I am listing some of the best websites to learn web development for free!

Choose a Development Specialization Based on Your Interest After learning the basics of web development choose an area of specialization based on your interest. Web Developers are categorized into three main types:

1. Front - End Developer: A front-end developer is a programmer that codes the front end of a website. Typically, the front-end developer's job is to convert website design files into raw HTML, JavaScript (JS), and/or CSS code. This includes the basic website design/layout, images, content, buttons, navigation, and internal links.

2. Back-End Developer: A backend developer is one who makes use of the technology required to develop the products for the backend of any website. A backend developer is responsible for building the structure of a software application. Backend developers typically work in groups or with a team.

3. Full-Stack Developer: A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server-side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client-side. Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management to do their job well. There are several other kinds of Web Developers also such as • Mobile Developer • Game Developer • Data Scientist Developer • Software Developer

Learn Required Programming Languages According To Your Development Specialization Based on your area of specialization, you will need to know how to use different kinds of programming languages for Web Development and Web Design. • Key programming languages for Front End Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are at the heart of Front End development. The three languages are relatively easy to learn and offer plenty of flexibility and creativity.

Knowledge of various DBMS technology is another important need of full-stack developers. MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQLServer are widely used for this purpose.

Practice Your Web Developing Skills on Various Projects All you need to do is to go to websites like Codewars, HackerOne, and Leetcode. To solve and compete with others in the problems available on those websites. The more you practice, the faster you will develop your skills. Most of these websites will help you go from basic level problems to higher levels step by step. Many government institutions, NGOs, and private institutes across the government-run courses from 6 months certificate courses to Ph.D. level courses.

Once you achieved proficiency in this work, you not only become eligible for a government or private job, but you can also start your own business. Various companies which rely on technology to store data and carry out their smooth business employ Web Developers at a good salary. Becoming a web developer is more than just working in the browser. Web developers write applications, and you are on that path. I encourage you to continue learning HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. But when you're comfortable, branch out to other languages and platforms. The more exposure and experience you have with other languages and platforms, the better you'll become as a developer.
