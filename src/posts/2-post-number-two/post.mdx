  Most people want to remain anonymous on the internet to protect their
  identities and activities from hackers. It's not easy to do that. Anti-virus
  software might be thought to be the best way to ensure safety. However,
  internet service providers (ISPs), have security measures that will protect
  your connection.
</p>

<blockquote>
  There are dozens of VPN services out there. Choose any of these to keep your
  online activities private and secure.
</blockquote>

<blockquote display="info">
  There's no such thing as absolute internet privacy and security, there's one
  tool you should think about adding to your arsenal: a virtual private network,
  or VPN.
</blockquote>

<h4>What a VPN does and why you should use one</h4>
<br />

This sounds complicated, but it's not. You and hundreds of others are driving down the highway with your car. He can track you wherever you go and pinpoint your location from a helicopter. You are completely unprotected.

Imagine that you are driving in a tunnel, but one only for your car. The hacker cannot see you and doesn't know you are there. You are effectively invisible.

Connecting to an open WiFi network, such as at a coffee shop, or on an airplane, is like driving an unprotected highway. You can use a VPN, which is a combination software and service to create a tunnel. A hacker cannot detect you, monitor or steal your information.

<br />

<h4>VPN pros and cons</h4>

**I want to clarify something:** A virtual private network (VPN) will not protect you against viruses or ransomware. Its only purpose is to conceal your internet activity from anyone who might want to track it for identity theft or any other purpose.

The good news is that If your work is primarily done at home, you don't likely need a VPN. This is because you are connecting to your private Wi-Fi network. A VPN would be unnecessary if it was not sufficiently secure (starting by password protection). The biggest threat is from open networks around the globe. However, you are most vulnerable if you borrow Wi-Fi from someone else in your apartment.

<blockquote>
  A VPN helps keep your online activities private, which is especially important
  when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks.
</blockquote>
<br />

<h4>A few more info to using a VPN.</h4>

First because your internet connection now passes through a secure server (the "tunnel") this means there is a performance hit. Sites may load slower, or video streaming might not be as reliable. The speed of public Wi-Fi networks is usually slow to begin with. This added layer can help to make them faster.

Second The VPN service may collect information about browsing habits and sell it to third parties. It's quite ironic, I know. This is something your ISP may do, so you will need to decide if this is an important feature. Choose a VPN which doesn't log user activity and don't share data with third party.

Last, there is a cost. Most VPNs charge a monthly or an annual subscription fee. While there are some decent free VPNs, they have many limitations and are more likely to sell your data.

<br />

<h4>How to Choose the Right VPN for You</h4>

Below are my top five VPN services. These choices were based on price, personal experience and aggregated reviews from other sources.

Many of these plans do not offer free trials so you won't be able to "get the wheels rolling." Most plans come with a money back guarantee. You will need to select a plan and use a credit card to bill, but you can cancel anytime within the window and receive a full refund.

<br />

<h4>Best VPN for global travelers:</h4>

<br />

The number and location of the VPN's servers is one way to determine its effectiveness. It is easier to locate a VPN server near you if it has more servers than it does. Faster performance is usually associated with closer servers.

CyberGhost boasts nearly 7,000 servers in more than 90 countries. Few other VPNs have such high numbers. The service's headquarters is in Romania, which doesn't have any data-collection laws. CyberGhost can therefore offer a policy of no-logs.

CyberGhost is the only VPN that offers a free trial, but it's only available for 24 hours. You'll need to select a plan after that. Each one comes with a generous 45 day money-back guarantee. These plans are priced at $12.99 a month. You can get significant discounts if your prepays for longer periods. The rate drops to $6.39 for prepaying for six months, which is $38.34 in total. Or, you can pay $58.50 for 2 years and get 2 months free.

<br />
<h4>Best independently audited VPN: TunnelBear</h4>
<br />
<img className="img-vpn-ghost" src="./images/TunnelBear02.png" />
<br />
VPNs can boast that they protect you from prying eyes and your personal data. Few
people put their money where there tunnel is. TunnelBear, which also boasts the cutest
mascot of CyberGhost, publishes independent security audits of its servers on a regular
basis.
<br />
<br />
You can pay $9.99 per month, $59.88 for a year, or $120 for three. TunnelBear is
also a great option for beginners, and something you should consider if this is
your first time.

<br />
<br />
<h4>Best overall VPN: NordVPN</h4>
<img className="img-vpn-ghost" src="./images/nordvpn.png" />
<br />
<br />
Over the years I have been involved in technology and NordVPN has always been at
the top of every "best VPN" list. It ticks almost all the boxes: decent speeds,
no logs privacy, robust server/count, easy interface -- and the company would
not be so highly rated if it didnâ€™t offer a better product.
<br />
<br />
NordVPN supports up to six concurrent connections and has over 5,200 servers across
60 countries. It might seem a bit overwhelming for some users and a bit intimidating
for novices. Multi-hop connections and Onion Over VPN are valuable features, but
they require some study. This is true for any VPN. However, I felt like I was in
over my head when I walked out of NordVPN's website.
<br />
<br />
NordVPN is the most expensive option. It costs $11.95 per monthly or $59 if
prepaying for one year. The two-year deal ($99 at the time of writing) is the
best, and includes three bonus months. These are only introductory rates.
Renewal prices could be higher. NordVPN offers a 30-day guarantee of
satisfaction on all plans.

<h4>Best VPN for serious privacy freaks: iVPN</h4>
<img className="img-vpn-ghost" src="./images/ipn03.png" />
<br />
<br />
There are two types of anonymous. iVPN is a great option for online privacy.
Even though the Standard plan is limited to two devices, it offers some amazing
protections.
<br />
<br />
The built-in AntiTracker tool, for example, promises protection against malware,
web trackers, ads, and other threats. For anonymity, you can sign up without revealing
an email address. You can also pay using Bitcoin. iVPN promises a zero-log policy,
audited operation, and more.
<br />
<br />
iVPN's payment options are also very affordable, especially if your preference
is a monthly option. The Standard plan, which costs $6 per month, comes with a
30-day money back guarantee if it doesn't work out for you.
<br />
<br />
For a reasonable $10 per month, the Pro plan allows you to use seven devices.

<h4>Best budget VPN: Mullvad</h4>
<img className="img-vpn-ghost" src="./images/mullvad.png" />
<br />
<br />
Most VPNs charge between $10-12 per month if you select a monthly plan. This is
quite high. It is true that there are discounts if you prepay for at least one
year. But what if you don't want to commit?
<br />
<br />
Enter Mullvad, which is a Sweden-based VPN provider that charges a flat monthly fee
regardless of how long you have subscribed. This rate is currently 5 euros and works
out to $5.91 US. You can also pay with Bitcoin, or actual cash if you prefer. There
are no discounts on longer subscriptions.
<br />
<br />

The budget price does not come at the expense of security or privacy. This VPN, like the best, keeps no logs and submits external audits. You can be sure that the product doesn't have affiliate partnerships. Mullvad can support up to five concurrent connections and has servers located in 36 countries, but less than 800 total.
