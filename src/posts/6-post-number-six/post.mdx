Doubtlessly data security is more serious than ever. As indicated by CSO, 63% of organizations encountered a data breach over the most recent year. In the meantime, attacks on IoT devices significantly increased in the first half of 2019. More portentously, social engineering assaults have expanded by an eye-watering 400% in light of COVID-19.

Privacy laws like the CCPA, GDPR, and LGPD were made for circumstances such as these. If you can have a look at GDPR compliant cookie policy, it will help understand things in depth. Authorization of CCPA formally starts July first, 2020. What's more, in August 2020, Brazil's new information protection law The Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) will authoritatively go into effect. Roused by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, LGPD is another milestone security charge that is set to affect the manner in which Brazilian organizations track, use, and store information. In the United States, the ongoing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) likewise manages comparable protection worries as both the GDPR and LGPD.

For some, organizations, exploring three contrasting arrangements of security enactment can be a nightmare. Numerous organizations gather, hold, and sell information that has been anonymized utilizing de-recognizable proof calculations or accumulation. Under the CCPA, organizations can keep on using this information without revelation. Under GDPR, pseudonymous information IS personal data. In the meantime, companies under the LGPD must comply with the law regardless of the data type, except in specific research settings. The rule of thumb to avoid any penalties is to comply with the GDPR privacy policy checklist. But as we know it is not easy and you always need additional support that’s why Exploit Hunters made compliance easy for clients’ cybersecurity management.

Using services of GDPR compliant cookie banners is a must-have for all small and medium-sized businesses. Cookiebot is one of the famous solution providers. So if you are concerned about penalties, such service should be included in your arsenal. Similarly, making arrangements for GDPR cookie consent-free can help overcome lots of non-compliance problems and ultimately can help save penalties.

When it comes to penalties, all three laws differ significantly in scope.
The GDPR has, by a wide margin, the most critical fines of the three. The highest GDPR penalties are €20 million or 4% of annual global income, whichever is higher. LGPD fines are 2% of yearly worldwide income or 50 million reals (~$12 million). Also, the CCPA fines hit a limit of $7,500.
