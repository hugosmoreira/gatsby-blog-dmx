          VPNs are really important regarding security and privacy online. Many
          people don't know but there are hundreds of thousands cyber attack per
          hour and every single person that use a device online can use a VPN to
          have more privacy and security online.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should I use a VPN</h3>
        <p>
          Over 500,000 cyber attacks happen every hour, and there are ways to
          protect yourself. Being a victim of a cyber attack can be devastating,
          and everyone should take precautions to protect themselves from being
          hacked. The easiest way to protect yourself from being hacked is to
          have a VPN.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A VPN is a virtual private network that protects your data from being
          intercepted by cyber criminals and hackers. A VPN will allow you to
          work and connect to the internet securely and privately, and won't
          allow others (like hackers and cybercriminals) to see what you're
          doing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          VPNs also make it possible for many people to enjoy the performance
          and speeds of a high-quality VPN service, as boutique service
          providers such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and PureVPN offer features such
          as live customer support, unthrottled data speeds, and dedicated IP
          addresses for as low as $5/month.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How do I use a VPN</h3>
        <p>1: Sign up for a VPN service.</p>
        <p>2: Turn on the VPN and choose a server.</p>
        <p>3: Open a browser and navigate to a website.</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I am writing this guide so that you can know how to setup a VPN on
          your computer or on your phone. Open your favorite browser on your
          computer and use the Current Location. It will automatically show you
          what you would be surfing on without a VPN. From there click on the
          search bar and search the destination site name. This can be whichever
          site you would like, and it doesn't matter what country it is. Just
          find the destination site and open it. While on the site, clear your
          browser and reopen it and the location will now show the use of a VPN.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can now use your favorite browser and access any site from any
          country.{' '}
